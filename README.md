# Information Privacy: An analysis of organisational practices
## Introduction
This is the project I undertook during my final year of University, being worth 50% of my degree it was important for me to remain consistent. Whether that be in research, goals or whatever else. This consistency allowed for 
the integration of new ideas and improvements while ensuring that my project is still aligned with the initial objective. From the beginning, the focus was on the privacy landscape and organisational practices. I received 80% on my project and was very pleased with it so I decided to add it here.
## Abstract
This project explores the challenges organisations face in ensuring information privacy and 
compliance with global privacy laws. My research investigates the implementation of policies and 
procedures, the evolution of privacy practices over the last decade and the factors influencing 
individual attitudes and behaviours towards privacy. A mixed-method approach was employed, 
including a quantitative analysis of three large websites’ privacy policies and the changes which 
they’ve undertaken in recent years and a survey, allowing for qualitative observations of user 
behaviour on these platforms.
The primary goal of this project is to address the lack of clarity surrounding information privacy on a 
global scale and I have created a comprehensive and user-friendly privacy compliance questionnaire 
that can be used by an organisation to assess and improve their privacy practices. The artefact is 
modular and adaptable to various industries and regions, addressing the global privacy landscape 
and the unique challenges which different organisations face. 
The privacy compliance questionnaire is organised into four categories: </br>
- Data Collection & Processing
- Data Storage & Security
- User Rights
- Third-Party Data Sharing
</br> <i>Including questions that cover the relevant areas of privacy laws on a global scale and provides a 
scoring system which allows an organisation to measure their compliance. </i>
</br>
The results of the project indicate that the questionnaire has the potential to significantly improve 
organisations privacy practices, leading to better compliance with global privacy laws, increasing 
trust among users. By using the artifact, organisations can identify gaps in their privacy policies and 
procedures, reduce the risk of fines and legal issues, and enhance their overall privacy and security 
of user data.
This project has successfully created a valuable tool that addresses the challenges associated with 
information privacy and compliance on a global scale. The privacy compliance questionnaire 
provides a framework for organisations to assess and improve their privacy practices, contributing to 
the broader goal of protecting user privacy worldwide.
Future research in this field will include updating the artifact, as it will eventually be outdated. 
Consequently, future research could also focus on continuously updating the artifact to reflect the 
latest privacy-related developments and legal requirements. This may involve monitoring changes in 
legislation, incorporating new best practices and adapting the artifact to address emerging privacy 
risks and challenges
